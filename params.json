{"name":"Tempo","tagline":"EEG visualization software","body":"### TEMPO\r\n\r\nTEMPO is open source software for 3D visualization of brain electrical activity. TEMPO accepts [EEG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) file in standard [EDF](http://www.edfplus.info/) format and creates animated sequence of topographic maps. Topographic maps are generated over 3D head model and user is able to navigate around head and examine maps from different viewpoints. Most mapping parameters are adjustable through appropriate graphical user interface controls. Also, individual topographic maps could be saved in [PNG](http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/) format for future examination or publishing.\r\n\r\nHere is a screen-shot of TEMPO in action:\r\n\r\n[![](https://github.com/asamardzic/tempo/blob/gh-pages/images/tempo-small.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/asamardzic/tempo/blob/gh-pages/images/tempo.png?raw=true)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
