    <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
    under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
    release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
    Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
    distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
    possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the
    Modified Version:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>A.</strong> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers,
          if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from
          those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be
          listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>B.</strong> List on the Title Page, as authors, one
          or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the
          modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least
          five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its
          principal authors, if it has less than five).</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>C.</strong> State on the Title Page the name of the
          publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>D.</strong> Preserve all the copyright notices of the
          Document.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>E.</strong> Add an appropriate copyright notice for
          your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>F.</strong> Include, immediately after the copyright
          notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use
          the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the
          form shown in the Addendum below.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>G.</strong> Preserve in that license notice the full
          lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in
          the Document&#39;s license notice.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>H.</strong> Include an unaltered copy of this
          License.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>I.</strong> Preserve the section entitled
          <span>&quot;History&quot;</span>, and its title, and add to it
          an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
          publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
          there is no section entitled <span>&quot;History&quot;</span> in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>J.</strong> Preserve the network location, if any,
          given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of
          the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the
          Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be
          placed in the <span>&quot;History&quot;</span> section. You may
          omit a network location for a work that was published at least
          four years before the Document itself, or if the original
          publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>K.</strong> In any section entitled
          <span>&quot;Acknowledgements&quot;</span> or
          <span>&quot;Dedications&quot;</span>, preserve the section&#39;s
          title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
          each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
          given therein.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>L.</strong> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of
          the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles.
          Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the
          section titles.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>M.</strong> Delete any section entitled
          <span>&quot;Endorsements&quot;</span>. Such a section may not be
          included in the Modified Version.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <p><strong>N.</strong> Do not retitle any existing section as
          <span>&quot;Endorsements&quot;</span> or to conflict in title
          with any Invariant Section.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
    of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
    list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license
    notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section
    titles.</p>

    <p>You may add a section entitled
    <span>&quot;Endorsements&quot;</span>, provided it contains nothing
    but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for
    example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved
    by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</p>

    <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
    and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
    the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
    through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
    includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
    by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
    you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
    permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</p>

    <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
    License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
    assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version .</p>
