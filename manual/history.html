    <p>Note: This section is written in first person (by <tt>TEMPO</tt>
    author) for the release of version 1.2.0 of software.

    <p>I wrote first version of <tt>TEMPO</tt> software during 1995 and
    1996, while working on my master thesis at the University of Belgrade
    (<tt>http://www.bg.ac.rs/</tt>) under lead of Prof. Dusan Starcevic.
    At the time, <span>OpenGL</span> library was not yet widely deployed
    on <span>PC</span> machines, so first <tt>TEMPO</tt> version employed
    dedicated implementation of scan-line hidden surface removal algorithm
    for 3D graphics. After lots of use of this software for various
    <span>EEG</span> related research at the University of Belgrade, an
    improved and adapted version was eventually sold to Cadwell
    Laboratories Inc., Kennewick, WA (http://www.cadwell.com/).

    <p>During next years, my research interests shifted away (actually, I
    was never particularly interested in <span>EEG</span>, but primarily
    in computer graphics), but I did take some part in couple of pilot
    projects at University of Belgrade considering implementation of 3D
    topographic mapping software based on <span>OpenGL</span> library for
    fast rendering. Most interesting of these certainly was project based
    on <span>VRML</span> and <span>Java</span> programming language, taken
    during 1998 under lead of Prof. Emil Jovanov. Anyway, none of these
    projects materialized to its end (in the sense of commercializing it
    or publishing it under an open source license) and on the other side
    time was passing and original <tt>TEMPO</tt> code base was not updated
    at all.

    <p>Thus, finally having some spare time near the end of summer 2003, I
    decided to update original <tt>TEMPO</tt> code, this time utilizing
    <span>OpenGL</span> library, and to publish it under <span>GPL</span>
    license. Eventually, I decided also to use <span>EDF</span> as a
    rather standard input format instead of only supporting proprietary
    format of <span>EEG</span> recording devices that we used during
    initial research, then to utilize <span>GTK+</span> toolkit for
    graphical user interface, and finally to give my <span>FFT</span>
    routines face lift too. So, the net result was that new version of
    <tt>TEMPO</tt> contained practically no code from original version.
    Publishing such updated <tt>TEMPO</tt> code (labeled as version 1.1.0)
    on SourceForge site (<tt>http://tempo.sourceforge.net/</tt>) generated
    lots of good interest initially; however, it became apparent soon that
    choice of <span>GTK+</span> toolkit wasn&#39;t particularly good idea,
    primarily because most of people interested in <tt>TEMPO</tt> were
    interested in having it working under <span>Windows</span>, while
    <span>GTK+</span> isn&#39;t particularly well supported under
    <span>Windows</span>. This unfortunate situation lasted for while,
    until <span>GPL</span>-ed version of <span>Qt</span> toolkit for
    <span>Windows</span> announced near the end of 2004. Having good
    experience with <span>Qt</span> toolkit on some commercial projects I
    worked on, I decided then to port <tt>TEMPO</tt> to <span>Qt</span>.
    An empty time slot appeared near the end of spring 2005, thus version
    1.2.0 of <tt>TEMPO</tt> is born and is generally available now. At
    summer 2008, the project hosting is moved from SourceForge to Google
    Code site.

    <p>Apart from <span>GUI</span> code, not much changed between
    <span>GTK+</span> and <span>Qt</span> <tt>TEMPO</tt> version, thus
    tradeoffs against original code are still as follows: <tt>TEMPO</tt>
    code base looks much better now than ever before (after all, I&#39;m
    now almost 9 years more experienced programmer), but it is again not
    tested at all. Former will hopefully benefit some of you, gentle
    readers, to eventually understand, improve and extend <tt>TEMPO</tt>
    code; regarding later, hopefully some other among you will help
    <tt>TEMPO</tt> author with testing with your own data files and
    sending suggestions and bug reports.
