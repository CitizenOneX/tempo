      <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
      other written document <span>&quot;free&quot;</span> in the sense of
      freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
      redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially
      or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
      author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
      being considered responsible for modifications made by others.</p>

      <p>This License is a kind of <span>&quot;copyleft&quot;</span>,
      which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be
      free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public
      License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p>

      <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
      free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
      that the software does. But this License is not limited to software
      manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject
      matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend
      this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
      reference.</p>
