    <p><tt>TEMPO</tt> is able to read <span>EEG</span> recordings in
    <span>EDF</span> (European Data Format) format. <span>EDF</span> is
    simple and flexible standard format for exchange and storage of
    simultaneously recorded physical signals. <span>EDF</span>
    specification, as well as pointers to converters from other commonly
    used <span>EEG</span> formats to <span>EDF</span> format, are
    available at <tt>http://www.hsr.nl/edf/</tt>.</p>

    <p><tt>TEMPO</tt> expects file name to be specified trough file
    selection dialog, that is in turn activated using first button in row
    of buttons in bottom right corner of application main window.</p>

    <p><tt>TEMPO</tt> has extensive error checking included. However,
    error reporting is rather primitive for now: when encountering
    unrecoverable error, <tt>TEMPO</tt> will print the error code and will
    terminate then. This information is intended for <tt>TEMPO</tt>
    developers, so please include it when reporting problem. More user
    friendly error reporting mechanism will be eventually added later.</p>

    <p>Thus, if for any reason (file does not exist, user does not have
    appropriate permissions to access file) <tt>TEMPO</tt> is unable to
    access to specified <span>EDF</span> file, the error code will be
    printed and program will be terminated. Otherwise, <tt>TEMPO</tt> will
    proceed to read <span>EDF</span> file header. Some important checks
    are performed on file header too. First, version of <span>EDF</span>
    data format is checked and then electrode names for <span>EEG</span>
    from <span>EDF</span> file are compared to names of electrodes known
    to <tt>TEMPO</tt>. <span>EDF</span> format is very flexible regarding
    types and arrangements of recorded signals. However, <tt>TEMPO</tt> is
    able to recognize only signals from electrodes named according to so
    called <span>10-10</span> (and, by inclusion, <span>10-20</span>)
    international standard. <span>EDF</span> file must contain signals
    from at least six alike electrodes in order to have <tt>TEMPO</tt> to
    accept file for mapping; otherwise, <tt>TEMPO</tt> will report an
    error.</p>

    <p>Actually, names (and positions) of electrodes are read from an
    external file. This file is in an <span>ASCII</span> format and it is
    possible to support additional electrodes. New electrode names are
    easy to add, but electrode positions should be precisely specified
    there, and that could be hard part. Thus, it is recommended to stick
    with <span>10-10</span> arrangement and to give appropriate names to
    electrodes in <span>EDF</span> file.</p>

    <p>If everything fine with <span>EDF</span> file header,
    <tt>TEMPO</tt> will proceed with reading scalp and face models (these
    models are, like electrodes information, stored in external files in
    an <span>ASCII</span> format) and will then show application main
    window. The screen-shot of <tt>TEMPO</tt> main window is given in
    Figure 1.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Left part of <tt>TEMPO</tt> main window is occupied by
    visualization window, displaying current topographic map. User could
    left click and drag mouse here, to have head model rotated. Dragging
    to left and right corresponds approximately to rotating head model
    around world y-axis (from head center to up) in 3D and dragging to up
    and down corresponds approximately to rotation head model around world
    x-axis (from head center to right).</p>

    <p>Right part of <tt>TEMPO</tt> main window is occupied by five groups
    of graphical user interface controls. Each control has a tool-tip
    explaining its purpose, and each control will be described in more
    details here. First four groups are enclosed by corresponding frames
    and fifth group consists of four buttons in bottom right corner of
    main window. First frame is intended to display information about
    recording only. Following informations from <span>EDF</span> file
    header are displayed here:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>local patient identification</li>

      <li>local recording identification</li>

      <li>start date and time of recording</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Second frame contains controls for selection of score to be
    topographically mapped and for adjusting its parameters. As for now,
    <tt>TEMPO</tt> supports three scores:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>raw <span>EEG</span> potential</li>

      <li>amplitude of potential <span>DFT</span> (Discrete Fourier
      Transform) values</li>

      <li>phase of potential <span>DFT</span> values</li>
    </ul>

    <p>First control in scores frame is menu for score selection (menu
    items are also showing score units - microvolts or radians). Other two
    controls are intended for further specification of <span>DFT</span>
    related scores and are disabled when raw potential selected in first
    control. Second control in scores frame is menu for number of raw
    potential samples used to calculate signal <span>DFT</span> (this
    number is often called <span>DFT</span> window or simply window).
    Allowed values are 128, 256 and 512 samples (<span>FFT</span>
    algorithm is used for <span>DFT</span> calculation, thus number of
    samples should be power of 2). Samples to calculate <span>DFT</span>
    are always taken from current point in input file backwards (thus,
    current time, that is representing current point in input file, could
    be adjusted when changing current score or <span>DFT</span> window ,
    if this is necessary to have enough samples before current point in
    input file for <span>DFT</span> calculation). Third control in scores
    frame is spin button for selecting current frequency for
    <span>DFT</span> scores. For each input vector of raw potential
    samples, <span>DFT</span> calculation produces output vector of same
    length of complex numbers. Each of these numbers corresponds to single
    frequency in input signal spectrum and only values for one specific
    frequency could be mapped at a time. Third control in scores frame is
    for specifying this frequency. The upper range of this spin button is
    always set according to Nyquist theorem of signal sampling: it is
    eventually adjusted when <span>DFT</span> window changes, but is
    always less or equal than one half of signal sampling frequency.</p>

    <p>Third frame contains controls pertaining to color legend. Lower
    half of values for given score are mapped to colors between blue and
    green, upper half of values are mapped to colors between green and
    red. Frame with legend controls contains also two spin buttons for
    controlling lowest (mapped to pure blue) and highest (mapped to pure
    red) score values represented by legend. <tt>TEMPO</tt> is using
    simple heuristic for calculating lowest and highest score value for
    raw potential score and highest values for <span>DFT</span> amplitudes
    (lowest value for each <span>DFT</span> amplitude is always 0 and
    <span>DFT</span> phase values are always between -pi and pi radians).
    Namely, each time when new score requested, <tt>TEMPO</tt> is
    calculating number of score values for each recognized signal from
    random positions in <span>EEG</span> file, and then using these values
    estimates lowest and highest score values for legend. Score values
    that are later found to be lower than lowest values or higher that
    highest values are clamped and mapped to pure blue and red color
    respectively. This heuristic give pretty good results in most cases,
    but depending on <span>EEG</span> file contents it could also miss
    completely. In these cases, spin buttons could be used to adjust
    boundaries. Current low boundary could be set anywhere between twice
    times initial lowest value and current high boundary, and high
    boundary could be set anywhere between current low boundary and twice
    times initial highest value. All of above considered, user has lots of
    freedom in selecting most appropriate resolution regarding mapping
    score values to color map. Low and high boundaries are remember for
    each score separately. Thus, when score changes using corresponding
    menu from score controls frame, boundaries for selected score are
    restored automatically.</p>

    <p>Fourth frame contains time related controls. First row of these
    controls is showing <span>EEG</span> file sampling frequency. Next row
    contains a spin button representing current time in seconds. When
    animation is ongoing, this button is disabled, but continuously
    updating, showing time that corresponds to current map, starting from
    beginning of the file. When animation stopped, user could use this
    button to jump to arbitrary position in the input file. As mentioned
    above, <tt>TEMPO</tt> also could adjust this value automatically, if
    necessary to have appropriate number of samples before current
    position in order to be able to calculate <span>DFT</span> related
    scores. Third row of time controls contains spin button for selecting
    animation step, i.e. for how many samples current position is advanced
    between generating two successive topographic maps. Like current time
    control, this control is disabled while animation is ongoing, but
    while animation stopped it could be used to select coarser time
    resolution. Three buttons for animation control appear in next row of
    time controls. First button is for starting animation, second button
    is for pausing animation and third button is intended to stop (pause
    and reset current time to smallest possible value) animation. Only one
    of these three buttons could be active at the same moment.
    <tt>TEMPO</tt> is also stopping animation automatically when
    encountering end of the <span>EEG</span> file. Last row of time
    controls contains slider for adjusting animation speed, i.e. how fast
    (or slow) the animation will run respective to real time flow.</p>

    <p>Last group of controls on the right side of <tt>TEMPO</tt> main
    window consists of four push buttons. First button is, as mentioned
    above, for opening new <span>EDF</span> file. Second button is
    intended for saving current topographic map in <span>PNG</span>
    format. Third button is intended to launch help browser and display
    help pages that you are now looking at. Finally, pressing fourth
    button quits <tt>TEMPO</tt> application.</p>
