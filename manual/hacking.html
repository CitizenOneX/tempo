    <h1><a name="hacking" id="hacking">Hacking</a></h1>

    <p>This section is intended as short road-map though <tt>TEMPO</tt>
    source code files. <tt>TEMPO</tt> code is pretty much populated with
    comments, and, as with any other open source project, source code is
    ultimate reference. Also, <span>Doxygen</span> format is used for
    commenting <tt>TEMPO</tt> classes interfaces, so <span>Doxygen</span>
    tool could be employed along with <tt>tempo.cfg</tt>
    <span>Doxygen</span> configuration file in <tt>TEMPO</tt> distribution
    root directory to generate documentation for these interfaces in
    various formats.</p>

    <p>Source code files are grouped in <tt>src</tt> subdirectory of
    <tt>TEMPO</tt> distribution. Subdirectory <tt>data</tt> contains files
    with face and scalp models, as well as file with electrode names and
    positions and sample <span>EDF</span> file. Subdirectory
    <tt>manual</tt> contain help files (what you are reading now) in
    <span>HTML</span> format. Subdirectory <tt>resources</tt> contains
    artwork (icon files). Subdirectory <tt>tmp</tt> is where compilation
    artifacts are stored (note however that executable is generated in
    <tt>TEMPO</tt> distribution root directory. File <tt>tempo.pro</tt> is
    <span>Qt</span> project file. Other files in <tt>TEMPO</tt>
    distribution root directory are rather standard files for any open
    source project.</p>

    <p><tt>TEMPO</tt> is written in <span>C++</span> programming language,
    using <span>OpenGL</span> library for 3D graphics and <span>Qt</span>
    toolkit for graphical user interface. Thus, familiarity with these
    technologies is necessary in order to be able to understand source
    code.</p>

    <p>When examining <tt>src</tt> subdirectory, one should start with
    <tt>vector.*</tt>, <tt>color.*</tt>, <tt>bounding_box.*</tt>,
    <tt>vertex.*</tt>, <tt>material.*</tt> and <tt>triangle.*</tt> files.
    These files contain definition of simple data structures to be used
    for constructing geometry model.</p>

    <p>One should proceed with <tt>object.*</tt> files then. These files
    contain definition of data structure and accompanying operations for
    geometry model. Two operations related to this data structure are
    especially important: creating model from given data file and
    rendering model using <span>OpenGL</span> routines. Input format for
    object geometry is simple <span>ASCII</span> format; input file
    contains arrays of vertices, normals, materials and triangles. Each
    array is preceded by number designating array length. Array elements
    are groups of numbers corresponding to fields of data structures
    mentioned above. Subdirectory <tt>data</tt> of <tt>TEMPO</tt>
    distribution contains files <tt>face.mo</tt> and <tt>scalp.mo</tt>
    with face and scalp models in above format. <span>OpenGL</span> code
    rendering object model is (as emphasized in comments) for simplicity
    left without any optimization (nevertheless, this code works pretty
    fast even on software-only <span>OpenGL</span> implementations).</p>

    <p>Files <tt>scene.*</tt> contain definition of data structure and
    accompanying operations for scene object. Scene object contains
    instances of face and scalp objects. Visualization created by
    <tt>TEMPO</tt> is pretty generic in the sense that this code could be
    utilized for any kind of visualization where some parts of scene are
    color coded from some interpolated values and other parts of scene
    rendered as is. Thus, instead of &quot;face&quot; and
    &quot;scalp&quot;, terms &quot;not mapped&quot; and &quot;mapped&quot;
    are utilized through <tt>TEMPO</tt> code. Also, term
    &quot;sensor&quot; is utilized later instead of term
    &quot;electrode&quot;. It would be actually very easy to utilize
    <tt>TEMPO</tt> rendering code to create visualization of say
    interpolated statical load across the bridge given measured loads in
    some points; but that is unrelated story.</p>

    <p>Geometry related parts of <tt>TEMPO</tt> code are completed with
    <tt>quaternion.*</tt> and <tt>rotation.*</tt> files. These files
    contain definition of rotation data structures and corresponding
    operations. Quaternions are used to calculate cumulative scene
    rotation after user interaction with mouse.</p>

    <p>Files <tt>exception.*</tt> contain definition of exceptions that
    could be thrown from <tt>TEMPO</tt> for error handling purposes.</p>

    <p>Signal processing related parts of <tt>TEMPO</tt> code begin with
    <tt>fft.*</tt> files. These files contain implementation of
    <span>FFT</span> procedure, together with caching of auxiliary data
    for faster execution.</p>

    <p>Files <tt>sensors.*</tt> contain data structure definition for
    electrodes (&quot;sensors&quot; in <tt>TEMPO</tt> terminology, as
    above explained) names and positions. These information are read from
    file in simple <span>ASCII</span> format: first line of file contains
    number of electrodes, and then follows lines with electrode
    information where length of electrode name is given first, then
    electrode name between quotation marks and finally electrode positions
    (in same coordinate system as face and scalp models are given).
    Subdirectory <tt>data</tt> of <tt>TEMPO</tt> distribution contains
    file <tt>10_10.ms</tt> with corresponding information for electrode
    arrangement according to <span>10-10</span> and <span>10-20</span>
    international standards.</p>

    <p>Reading of input <span>EDF</span> file and calculating
    <span>EEG</span> scores is distributed between <tt>input.*</tt> and
    <tt>signal.*</tt> files. Former files contain definition of data
    structure and operations to read <span>EDF</span> file header and to
    calculate array of <span>EEG</span> score values given needed set of
    samples on each electrode. Later files contain definition of data
    structure representing individual <span>EEG</span> channel and
    operations to read corresponding signal header from <span>EDF</span>
    file and provide set of signal samples of given length at given
    position in <span>EDF</span> file (this operation is used by above
    mentioned function from <tt>input.cpp</tt> file calculating array of
    <span>EEG</span> score values). Important to note is that function
    from <tt>input.cpp</tt> file reading <span>EDF</span> header is also
    looking at signal headers and comparing signal names to names known to
    above discussed sensors object (an instance of this object is passed
    to this function). Thus, signal objects are created only for channels
    from <span>EDF</span> file whose names corresponds to names of
    electrodes known to <tt>TEMPO</tt>.</p>

    <p>Mapping of score values to colors is encapsulated in interpolation
    object, defined in <tt>interpolation.*</tt> files. Weight coefficients
    for each scalp vertex according to vertex distance from set of nearest
    electrodes are calculated during initialization of this object and
    used later to actually perform interpolation. Mapping of values to
    color pallette is also defined here.</p>

    <p>Two simple <span>Qt</span> widgets are defined in
    <tt>gradient_widget.*</tt> and <tt>visualization_widget.*</tt> files
    respectively. First widget is drawing color legend and is later
    instantiated in legend frame of <tt>TEMPO</tt> main window. Second
    widget is actually showing <span>OpenGL</span> rendering and is later
    instanced in left half of <tt>TEMPO</tt> main window.</p>

    <p>Set of files <tt>info_widget.*</tt>, <tt>score_widget.*</tt>,
    <tt>legend_widget.*</tt> and <tt>time_widget.*</tt> contain code for
    creating graphical user interface and handling appropriate events for
    corresponding frames on right half of <tt>TEMPO</tt> main window. This
    code is bulky, but is rather simple actually.</p>

    <p>Files <tt>main_widget.*</tt> contain code for <tt>TEMPO</tt>
    application main widget, that is uniting highest level components of
    above together. Files <tt>manual_widget.*</tt> contain implementation
    of simple browser for <tt>TEMPO</tt> help files.</p>

    <p>Finally, <tt>main.cpp</tt> is file containing program
    <tt>main()</tt> function</p>
