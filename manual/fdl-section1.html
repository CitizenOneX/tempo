    DEFINITIONS</a></h1>

    <p>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
    under the terms of this License. The
    <span>&quot;Document&quot;</span>, below, refers to any such manual or
    work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
    <span>&quot;you&quot;</span>.</p>

    <p>A <span>&quot;Modified Version&quot;</span> of the Document means
    any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</p>

    <p>A <span>&quot;Secondary Section&quot;</span> is a named appendix or
    a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For
    example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
    Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship
    could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with
    related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or
    political position regarding them.</p>

    <p>The <span>&quot;Invariant Sections&quot;</span> are certain
    Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of
    Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is
    released under this License.</p>

    <p>The <span>&quot;Cover Texts&quot;</span> are certain short passages
    of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in
    the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</p>

    <p>A <span>&quot;Transparent&quot;</span> copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is
    available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and
    edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or
    (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
    drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
    for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety
    of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
    otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to
    thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
    Transparent. A copy that is not <span>&quot;Transparent&quot;</span>
    is called <span>&quot;Opaque&quot;</span>.</p>

    <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
    or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
    HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include
    PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
    by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
    processing tools are not generally available, and the
    machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
    purposes only.</p>

    <p>The <span>&quot;Title Page&quot;</span> means, for a printed book,
    the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to
    hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the
    title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as
    such, <span>&quot;Title Page&quot;</span> means the text near the most
    prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning
    of the body of the text.</p>
