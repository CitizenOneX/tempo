Copy some files to the output directory after compilation:

The "manual" directory is required on startup, as is the "resources" directory, which contains the icons.
The "data" folder contains some standard electrode positioning coordinates (and a sample EDF file.)
The various runtime libraries could be added via path setting no doubt, but I've copied them in here.
